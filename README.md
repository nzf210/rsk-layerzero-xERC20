## Introduction

This guide demonstrates implementing cross-chain token transfers using **OFT** (Omnichain Fungible Token) between **Rootstock Testnet** and **Ethereum Sepolia Testnet** via **LayerZero's OFT V2 protocol**.

You'll learn to:
- Set up Hardhat for cross-chain deployments
- Deploy an OFT contract for token transfers between chains
- Configure LayerZero endpoints for cross-chain communication
- Execute transfers between Rootstock and Ethereum Sepolia testnets

## Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you'll need:

- **Node.js**: v18.18.0+ ([Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or use [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage Node versions)
- **Code Editor**: Any editor of your choice
- **RPC Providers**: 
  - [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) or [Infura](https://infura.io/) for Ethereum Sepolia
  - [Rootstock RPC](https://rpc.rootstock.io/) for Rootstock Testnet
- **Metamask**: [Install](https://metamask.io/) and connect to [Ethereum Sepolia](https://chainlist.org/chain/11155111) and [Rootstock Testnet](https://chainlist.org/chain/31)
- **Test Funds**: [Sepolia ETH](https://sepoliafaucet.com/) and [Rootstock RBTC](https://faucet.rootstock.io/)

> **Important**: Ensure you have sufficient test tokens on both networks.

## Project Setup

### 1. Clone LayerZero Project Repo

Clone the repository:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/rsksmart/rsk-layerzero-xERC20.git
```

### 2. Setup environment variables

Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the environment variables with your own values.


```markdown
# By default, the examples support both mnemonic-based and private key-based authentication
# You don't need to set both of these values, just pick the one that you prefer and set that one
MNEMONIC=
PRIVATE_KEY=
```

### 3. Configure chains 

Once the project is created, go to `hardhat.config.ts` and configure the chains you want to deploy to.

> **Note**: For better performance and reliability, use a custom RPC endpoint as suggested in the prerequisites section.

```typescript
networks: {
    'sepolia-testnet': {
        eid: EndpointId.SEPOLIA_V2_TESTNET,
        url: process.env.RPC_URL_SEPOLIA || 'https://ethereum-sepolia-rpc.publicnode.com',
        accounts,
    },
    'rootstock-testnet': {
        eid: EndpointId.ROOTSTOCK_V2_TESTNET,
        url: process.env.RPC_URL_ROOTSTOCK_TESTNET || 'https://public-node.testnet.rsk.co',
        accounts,
    }
}
```
### 5. Deploying contracts

After adding your MNEMONIC or PRIVATE_KEY to your dotenv file and adding networks in your hardhat.config.ts, run the following command to deploy your LayerZero contracts:


```bash
npx hardhat lz:deploy
```

You will be prompted to select which chains to deploy to, if you wish to deploy to all blockchain networks selected, simply hit enter to continue deployment.


```typescript
info:    Compiling your hardhat project
Nothing to compile
✔ Which networks would you like to deploy? › rootstock-testnet, sepolia-testnet
✔ Which deploy script tags would you like to use? … 
info:    Will deploy 2 networks: rootstock-testnet, sepolia-testnet
warn:    Will use all deployment scripts
✔ Do you want to continue? … yes
Network: sepolia-testnet
Deployer: 0xD742C64Ab7ba8d31cee0594b4dc61b1ed8321246

info:    ✓ Your contracts are now deployed
```

### 6. Configuring layerzero OApp

To configure your OApp, you will need to change your layerzero.config.ts for your desired pathways. In this example, we will be using the `MyOFT` contract for our OFT. 


You can initialize your OApp configurations by running:

```bash
npx hardhat lz:oapp:config:init --contract-name MyOFT --oapp-config layerzero.config.ts
```

Once this command is executed, you will be prompted to select the chain you setup in your layerzero.config.ts file. 

```typescript 
✔ Select the networks to include in your OApp config › rootstock-testnet, sepolia-testnet
```

Then go to your layerzero.config.ts file and format it using cmd + shift + p and select `Format Document`.

Each pathway contains a config, containing multiple configuration structs for changing how your OApp sends and receives messages, specifically for the chain your OApp is sending from:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `sendLibrary` | Address | The message library used for configuring all sent messages `from` this chain. (e.g., `SendUln302.sol`) |
| `receiveLibraryConfig` | Struct | A struct containing the receive message library address (e.g., `ReceiveUln302.sol`), and an optional BigInt, `gracePeriod`, the time to wait before updating to a new MessageLib version during version migration. Controls how the `from` chain receives messages. |
| `receiveLibraryTimeoutConfig` | Struct | An optional param, defining when the old receive library (`lib`) will expire (`expiry`) during version migration. |
| `sendConfig` | Struct | Controls how the OApp sends `from` this pathway, containing two more structs: `executorConfig` and `ulnConfig` (DVNs). |
| `receiveConfig` | Struct | Controls how the OApp (`from`) receives messages, specifically the `ulnConfig` (DVNs). |
| `enforcedOptions` | Struct | Controls the minimum destination gas sent to the destination, per message type (e.g., `_lzReceive`, `lzCompose`, etc.) in your OApp. |

### 7. Wiring the OApp

```bash
npx hardhat lz:oapp:wire --oapp-config layerzero.config.ts
```

This command sets up the necessary connections between your deployed contracts on different chains.


### 8. Verify Contracts

You can verify your contracts by running the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat verify --network <network> <contract-address> <constructor-arguments>
```

For example, to verify the `MyOFT` contract on Rootstock Testnet, you would run:

```bash

npx hardhat verify --network rootstock-testnet <contract-address> "MyOFT" "MOFT" <endpoint-address> <owner-address>
```


> **Note:** Replace `<endpoint-address>` with the LayerZero endpoint address for the respective network and `<owner-address>` with your deployer address.

You can monitor your cross-chain transactions using:

- [LayerZero Scan](https://layerzeroscan.com/) - Official LayerZero explorer
- [Rootstock Explorer](https://explorer.testnet.rsk.co/) - For Rootstock testnet transactions
- [Sepolia Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/) - For Ethereum Sepolia transactions


## OFT Minting Task

To mint OFT tokens on a specific network, you can use the following command:

```shell
npx hardhat lz:oft:mint \
  --contract <OFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS> \
  --network <NETWORK_NAME> \
  --amount <AMOUNT_TO_MINT> \
  --private-key <YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>
```

**Important Security Note**: Never share your private key or commit it to source control. Use environment variables or secure key management solutions instead.

For safer usage, store your private key in an environment variable:

```shell
# First set the environment variable
export PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here

# Then use it in the command
npx hardhat lz:oft:mint \
  --contract 0xYourContractAddress \
  --network rootstock-testnet \
  --amount 10 \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

If no recipient is specified, tokens will be minted to the address associated with the provided private key.

Note: This task requires using a contract with a mint function (e.g., `MyOFTMock`). The standard `MyOFT` contract doesn't have this function.

## Cross-Chain Token Transfer

After minting tokens, you can send them between networks using the LayerZero protocol. The `lz:oft:send` task allows you to transfer tokens from one chain to another seamlessly.

### Sending Tokens from Source to Destination Chain

```shell
npx hardhat lz:oft:send \
  --contract <SOURCE_CHAIN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS> \
  --recipient <RECIPIENT_ADDRESS> \
  --source <SOURCE_NETWORK> \
  --destination <DESTINATION_NETWORK> \
  --amount <AMOUNT_TO_SEND> \
  --privatekey <YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>
```

For example, to send tokens from Sepolia to Rootstock:

```shell
npx hardhat lz:oft:send \
  --contract 0xa574d50d1a0244625D46eB0209E819e8AbBc4ee2 \
  --recipient 0xYourAddress \
  --source sepolia-testnet \
  --destination rootstock-testnet \
  --amount 1 \
  --privatekey $PRIVATE_KEY
```

Or to send tokens from Rootstock to Sepolia:

```shell
npx hardhat lz:oft:send \
  --contract 0x2F00bB23390cC48b4ce3DeD692792c0320406ED1 \
  --recipient 0xYourAddress \
  --source rootstock-testnet \
  --destination sepolia-testnet \
  --amount 1 \
  --privatekey $PRIVATE_KEY
```

**Note**: Make sure you have:
1. Minted tokens on the source network
2. Sufficient native tokens (ETH on Sepolia, RBTC on Rootstock) to pay for gas fees and LayerZero fees
3. The correct contract addresses for each network

The transaction can take a few minutes to be confirmed on both chains, as it needs to be processed by LayerZero's infrastructure. You can track the status of your cross-chain transaction using [LayerZero Scan](https://layerzeroscan.com/).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

- Ensure you have sufficient test tokens on both networks
- Verify your RPC endpoints are working correctly
- Check that your contracts are properly configured for cross-chain messaging
- Examine transaction logs for specific error messages
